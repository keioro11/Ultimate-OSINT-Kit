# Ultimate-OSINT-Kit
Extreme powerful browser kit for gaining information from open sources üîé

## Browser
* For more privacy and control, I recommend using [LibreWolf](https://librewolf.net)
* It's based on Firefox but with less telemetry, tracking mechanisms and has built in privacy search engines like DuckDuckGo.
* Follow their website for installation, documentation and source code.
* You can use any other minimal, open-source browser on the Gecko or WebKit engines.

## Bookmarks
* Bookmarks will be the 95% of our browser functionality.
* Finding, sorting and comparing 3000 tools manually took me a week, 3 hours everyday.
* I will add more tools with time))
  
### How to import bookmarks:
1. Get **bookmarks.json** file from repo.
2. Go to the LibreWolf Settings.
3. In the General section, find "Import browser data".
4. Click "Import Data" and select "Bookmarks from HTML file".
5. Choose **bookmarks.json** and click Open.
6. Click "Ctrl + Shift + O".
7. Go into "Bookmarks Menu" section in left bar.
8. Select all and drag or move to "Bookmarks Toolbar"
9. Now u can use bookmarks üëç))

## Extensions
* In **extensions.txt** I collected links for most useful mozilla extensions for online investigator.
* My favorite and key ones are (pin them for easier use):
* uBlock Origin - Effective blocker for ads, trackers, telemetry and unwanted content))
* User-Agent Switcher - Change user-agent for anonymity, for example - if your device is restricted on website.
* Simple Translate - Quickly translate in a compact window.

## Privacy Settings
* I corrected many settings to be sure that telemetry and other mozilla tracking options are disabled or less noticable.
* In fact there are some extensions and settings such as "privacy.firstparty.isolate", LocalCDN, Decentraleyes that can increase privacy but broke some sites, so i didnt enabled or used them.
* For information about all of them [about:config](https://kb.mozillazine.org/About:config_entries)

### How to import privacy settings:
1. Get **user.js** file from the repo.
2. In blank page type "about:profiles" and click enter.
3. There will be profile with "default" or "default-default" suffix, find "Root Directory" text below it.
4. Click "Open Directory" button next to it.
5. Now you're in the default profile's folder.
6. Copy there the **user.js** file.
7. After restarting browser the settings will be imported.
8. Compare them with [about:config](https://kb.mozillazine.org/About:config_entries) and enable/disable on your choose.
