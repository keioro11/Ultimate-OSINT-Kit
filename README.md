# Ultimate-OSINT-Kit
Extreme powerful browser kit for gaining information from open sources üîé

## Browser
* For more privacy and control recommend using [LibreWolf](https://librewolf.net/)
* It's based on Firefox but with less telemetry, tracking mechanisms and has built in privacy search engines like DuckDuckGo.
* Follow their website for installation, documentation and source code.
* You can use any other minimal, open-source browser on the Gecko or WebKit engines.

## Bookmarks
* Bookmarks will be the 95% of our browser functionality.
* Finding, sorting and comparing 3000 tools manually took me a week, 3 hours everyday.
* I will be thankful if u give a star üôè))
